# Instructions

PowerShell scripts to read sensors from `Open Hardware Monitor` and return to `HASS.Agent`.

## Requirements

- [Open Hardware Monitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org/)
- [HASS.Agent](https://lab02-research.org/hassagent/)
- Windows 11
- PowerShell

## Scripts available

- [CPU Temperature](./scripts/cpu-temperature.ps1)
- [CPU Frequency](./scripts/cpu-frequency.ps1)
- [CPU Load](./scripts/cpu-load.ps1)
- [Memory Usage](./scripts/memory-usage.ps1)
- [GPU Temperature](./scripts/gpu-temperature.ps1)
- [GPU Frequency](./scripts/gpu-frequency.ps1)
- [GPU Load](./scripts/gpu-load.ps1)
- [GPU VRAM Usage](./scripts/gpu-vram-usage.ps1)

## Open Hardware Monitor

1. Download `Open Hardware Monitor` and unzip it: https://openhardwaremonitor.org/

1. Run `OpenHardwareMonitor.exe` as Administrator.

1. If you want, configure it to startup with Windows. Click on `Options` menu and then:

    - [x] Start minimized
    - [x] Minimize to Tray
    - [x] Run on Windows startup

## HASS.Agent

1. Download `HASS.Agent` and install it: https://lab02-research.org/hassagent/

1. Follow the instructions to connect `HASS.Agent` to your Home Assistant and MQTT servers (required to send sensors data from PC to Home Assistant).

1. (Optional) Configure the `Satellite Service` to allow the `HASS.Agent` to work when the user is not logged on Windows.

1. Add `Sensors` following the `Script usage` instructions below.

## Script usage

1. Make sure that `Open Hardware Monitor` is running in background.

1. Copy or create the `.ps1` script as you want.

    In the script content you need to:

    - Import the `read-sensor.ps1` script:
    - Call the `Read-Sensor` function setting the `SensorType` and `Name` respectively.

    > Don't forget to copy the [read-sensor.ps1](./scripts/read-sensor.ps1) to the same folder

1. Test your script pasting the `path` to the `.ps1` file on the PowerShell terminal, ex:

    ```
    C:\scripts\gpu-temperature.ps1
    ```

1. On `HASS.Agent` add a new `Local Sensor` -> select `PowerShellSensor` -> and paste the path to the `.ps1` file (ex. `C:\scripts\gpu-temperature.ps1`) in the `powershell command or script` field.

1. Save and you are done! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

Some `SensorType` and `Name` are not always the same in `Open Hardware Monitor` GUI and on PowerShell script.

So, to find the correct sensors available in PowerShell, run the script [list-sensors.ps1](./scripts/list-sensors.ps1) on Terminal.

Example:
